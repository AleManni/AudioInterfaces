# AudioInterfaces

Audio interfaces is a work in progress library aiming to provide designables and highly customizable UIs to be used in conjunction with a third party Audio framework (e.g. Audiokit)
Some CG designables have been largerly inspired by Ray Wenderlich tuts but noticeable improvements have been made in terms of:
- added features
- architecture 
- drawing logic

A storyboard have been added to the project in order to demonstrate the product.

At the moment the following has been implmented and is fully functional:
- Continuous knob
- Stepped knob
- Tap tempo (PadView)

Coming soon:
- Framework package with Carthage support
- Additional Calculator and gesture recognizer for the Pad object. This will allow the Pad to be used as a 2-values generator for effects parameters.
